So it all started out with a tweet

Nothing like telling everyone you're going to do something to force yourself into totally doing it.

So I started working on this. Right now this is pretty much the default gatsby blog. There are some nice things coming over to gatsby from jekyll, the expressiveness of jsx over some templating engine is always nice. The `automagical` aspect of gatsby is in the source code, I just have to go and learn it.

The build process on ubuntu has been far from great. None of the gatsby cli works on my ubuntu instance, maybe it's my npm setup (I'm experimenting with asdf-vm). Right now I need to `gatsby clean` on my development machine, run `gatsby build`, commit my public folder, and host that on a http-server. Maybe I need to write some hack to make it better, maybe the solution exists, but I sure as heck couldn't find it.

I might publish another post explaining into more details what I've done with this blog and also the server this is running on, but for now I will focus on a few posts based on [Charlie Gerard's](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie) brilliant presentation from jsconf asia.

Here's a [sneak peek](https://httpserve.tenzhiyang.com/knnTransferLearning/) at one of my examples that I have in mind.
