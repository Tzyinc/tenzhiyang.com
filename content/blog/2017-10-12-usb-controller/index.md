When playing Binding of Isaac which was a dual thumb stick shooter (control character with one thumb stick, control direction of your bullets with another) , I realised that the market does not really sell a controller that has dual thumb sticks in the center, most are either too far down (PS style) or at offset positions (Xbox style). As I wanted to make some custom controllers for a while (more on that when the parts arrive!), I decided to make a USB controller specifically for this game.
