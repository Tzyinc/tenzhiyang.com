I think the problem with my 2019 idea was that unless we had a flawless implementation, we couldn’t demonstrate the idea properly. Our 2018 demonstration sucked ass but the idea was very obvious, the presentation itself was also very easy to understand what was going on at the end.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the project was an incredibly small scope. using a deterministic solution is really the key here. Having something that wasn’t up to chance means debugging is really do-able.</p>\n<p>Finally I think complexity of UI made this project take just a little bit too much time. UI has to look good, but it has also have to be simple.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Post hackathon 2018","date":"August 05, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-08-05-post-hackathon/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-10-16-sg-carparks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"@sg_carparks_bot"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-09-10-sew-many-images/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sew Many Images"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["426816048","444714259"]}
