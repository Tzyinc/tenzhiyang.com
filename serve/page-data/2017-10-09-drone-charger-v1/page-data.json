I needed a Device to turn off power after charging my Hubsan X4 for exactly 1 hour, as over charging the batteries was highly discouraged. I got a cheap Arduino micro clone I had lying around and attached it to a couple of female jumper wires. This was then connected to a relay. The timer is hardcoded into the Arduino. Maybe one day I will upgrade it with an LCD and some buttons, maybe use a one channel relay since that is all I need and put it in a proper enclosure. In the meantime, this will do!</p>\n<p><img class=\"gatsby-remark-images-extra\" src=\"/static/8298575e0b879741c17850d516abac1b/c739e/lipo.jpg\"/></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"LiPo USB Charger (From Old Portfolio)","date":"October 09, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-10-09-drone-charger-v1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-10-08-Bottle-Dynamo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Bottle Dynamo (From Old Portfolio)"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-10-10-iot-scale/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IoT Scale (From Old Portfolio)"}}}}}
