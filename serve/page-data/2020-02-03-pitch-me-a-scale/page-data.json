I’ve never played guitar before in my life, I can play very simple four chord songs on an ukulele, but guitar always seemed like such a step up from ukulele. In the end I justified to myself that since there are so much resources on guitar playing and in so many different styles, I could learn to be average at the guitar and then transfer those skills back into the ukulele.</p>\n<p>After practicing on the C major scale for a couple of weeks, as well as the “four chords” (C G Am F on ukulele, G, D, E, C on guitar) I decided it was time to actually practice more scales. I already casually watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamneelybass\">@adamneelybass</a> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ\">youtube</a> and have left his 5 hour practice video in the background while working.</p>\n<p>So I needed to find a way to learn and practice scales. I also bad at identifying tones or even notes on the neck. Splitting this problem up, I need 2 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify what note I am playing</li>\n<li>Display what notes to play</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course I would have liked to write some solution that identifies chords, but after some research, I found that multi tonal pitch detection is a very difficult problem to solve, and JS likely isn’t the best tool for that job (I like writing “serverless” apps). I stumbled across this really <a href=\"https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect\">short and sweet repo for guitar tuning</a> by <a href=\"https:twitter.com/cwilso\">@cwilso</a> and found that it was really well written and easy to re-purpose.</p>\n<p>Playing around with it, I found that when playing a note on a guitar, it was fairly consistent in pitch, although the attack and decay might be messed up. My solution to remove noise from deliberate notes is to have a queue that I constantly check. If the entire queue is of that same note, I can assume that that’s a deliberate note. The next thing is generating scales. For this I wrote a <a href=\"https://codepen.io/Tzyinc/pen/QWweQXa\">helper function</a> to generate scales from a root note and a step pattern like <code class=\"language-text\">4-H-W-4-H</code> where W is a whole step and H is a half step (and numbers are just the number of steps).</p>\n<p>Here’s my <a href=\"scale%20practicing%20prototype\">https://app.tenzhiyang.com/tuner/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pitch me a scale","date":"February 03, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-02-03-pitch-me-a-scale/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-01-29-twitter-upgrade-again/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding a bot to post updates to twitter"}},"next":null}}}
