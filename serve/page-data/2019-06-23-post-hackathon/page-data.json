It sucks not because I didn’t win, not because I think my project was better than the other teams’ but mostly because of how hard we worked and how little results came of it. There’s a few ways of looking at this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The idea just wasn’t presetable. I don’t really believe this is the case, as another group did something similar (but just better) and achieved great results.</li>\n<li>I am too unfamiliar with CNNs and transfer learning. This can be easily solved. I will eventually release a library that does all the heavy lifting for us.</li>\n<li>Our team composition and my delegation wasn’t good. I really think I lucked into my first team where I didn’t have to worry about whatever aspect that I delegated to. This time I think we should have maybe had one more backend and less FE devs. The AI was also kind of easy to implement maybe someone else would have been faster</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Post SEA hackathon 2019","date":"June 23, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-06-23-post-hackathon/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-06-16-post-js-conf/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Post js conf"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-06-28-start-of-new-era-maybe-maybenot/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Start of a new Era? maybe?"}}}}}
