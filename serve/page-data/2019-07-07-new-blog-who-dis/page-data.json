Right now this is pretty much the default gatsby blog. There are some nice things coming over to gatsby from jekyll, the expressiveness of jsx over some templating engine is always nice. The <code class=\"language-text\">automagical</code> aspect of gatsby is in the source code, I just have to go and learn it.</p>\n<p>The build process on ubuntu has been far from great. None of the gatsby cli works on my ubuntu instance, maybe it’s my npm setup (I’m experimenting with asdf-vm). Right now I need to <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby clean</code> on my development machine, run <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby build</code>, commit my public folder, and host that on a http-server.
