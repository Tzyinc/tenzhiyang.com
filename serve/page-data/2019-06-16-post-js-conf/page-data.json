Here’s a few actionable things I want to do after what I’ve learnt at jsconf:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Blog more.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is really not too related to jsconf, but I did read <a href=\"https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/\">this brilliant post by swyx</a> and it’s crazy inspiring. I’m not him and it’s unlikely I will be as active and as motivated as him, but I think this is a good way to be some inbetween, I may not be the second swyx or the second gaow, but at least I can be the first tenzy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Play more with Tensorflow.js (and maybe git gud at AI once and for all)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie\">Charlie Gerard</a> made some really cool demos on stage, and after using the tensorflow.js in the hackathon (more on that next post) I realised that AI tools are so accessible now, I really should be doing more.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate more in twitter</p>\n<ul>\n<li>particularly, write TILs for what I’ve learnt. Initally I wanted to do something every day, but I’m not really keeping up with it, so I will have to fine tune the frequency</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use more diverse frameworks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The talk from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/youyuxi\">Evan You</a> made me rethink about framework loyalty. Every framework solving a different problem is such an obvious conclusion but the fact that I never reached there on my own makes me feel that I actually have some software engineering maturing to do</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Join community events more frequently</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was after all the super silly hackathon that introduced me to this event and also the free tickets. Not to mention my dvd logo being plastered all over the event. I feel that there’s only good to be had from being in the community events, and in the worst case, maybe I’ll help someone</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Post js conf","date":"June 16, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-06-16-post-js-conf/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-05-28-amp-slides/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Amp Slides"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-06-23-post-hackathon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Post SEA hackathon 2019"}}}}}
